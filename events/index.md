### JavaOne : October 25-29, 2015 : San Francisco, CA
[Alex Snaps](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=snaps&search.event=javaoneEvent) speaks about Ehcache3:JSR 107 on Steroids [CON10204]
As the EG is looking at addressing the current shortcomings of JSR 107 with a future JCache 2.0 API, what can you do now to address your advanced caching use cases? Go for proprietary APIs? The brand new Ehcache3, besides ease of use, was crafted with that exact goal in mind: looking beyond the current spec. With close to no API tie-ins, Ehcache3 enables you to extend the JSR 107 API transparently. Whether you want to go off-heap and scale up; scale out by clustering your caches; or require transactions, automatic resource control, or scaling out of writes with write-behind, everything is available to you through a couple of configuration tweaks. Not only minimally intrusive but also available for free today in the open source Ehcache v3.

[Chris Dennis along with Brian Oliver (Architect, Oracle)](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=dennis&search.event=javaoneEvent) host Birds of a Feather Session – JCache 2.0: Where Do We Go from Here? [BOF6835]
The Java caching standard (JSR 107) was finally released in 2014, after 13 years of on-and-off work. The caching community has already started to move on, however. There is already discussion of what is missing from the current standard and what could or should be included in JCache 2.0. The JSR 107 specification leads and expert group members would like to engage the community in an open discussion of JCache 2.0. What important features are missing from JSR 107? What use cases should a future JCache 2.0 support? What features would be required to support those use cases? Attend this BOF session, get your voice heard, and engage directly with the rest of the caching community to help define the genesis of a JCache 2.0 standard.

### Devoxx : November 9-13, 2015 : Antwerp, Belgium
Speakers to be announced.
